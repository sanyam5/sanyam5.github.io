I am part-time actor. I sometimes sing and do stand-up comedy and I love travelling. I love reading and discussing about Physics and the universe in my free time. Open-ended discussions on consciousness, intelligence, morals, etc. excite me. Drop a mail in case you are interested in discussing any of the above.
