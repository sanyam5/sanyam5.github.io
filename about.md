Hi my name is Sanyam Agarwal. I am currently a Visiting Research Scholar at the [Machine Learning and Perception lab at Georgia Tech](http://mlp.cc.gatech.edu/) led by [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/). I work on Machine Learning at the intersection of vision and Langugage.

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in May 2016. I just love computer science. Checkout my [GitHub](http://github.com/sanyam5). 

I am also part-time actor. I sometimes sing and do stand-up comedy and I love travelling.


### More Information

I love reading and discussing about Physics and the universe in my free time. Open-ended discussions on consciousness, intelligence, morals, etc. excite me. Drop a mail in case you are interested in discussing any of the above.
